#RecursiveStateMachine implementation in C++
by Manolis Paterakis

General Description
===================
This is an experimental implementation of a recursive state machine, based on
some research ideas I came up after my architecture postgrad diploma thesis on
the differences between object-oriented and recursive systems.
This is work in progress, and by no means claims to become a project containing
usable code. Please do not use in any (production or development) environment.

If you read my code and come up with any ideas or suggestions, please drop me a
message. I will gladly appreciate it.
